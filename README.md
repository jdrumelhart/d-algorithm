Dijkstra's Algorithm Project
by Bert Davies, Eric Liu, and Joseph Rumelhart

Introduction:
	The purpose of the Dijkstra's algorithm project was to demonstrate our skills in understanding complex algorithms and implement them in a Java project. Dijkstra's algorithm is a way to find the shortest path between an initial node and all other nodes in a directed or undirected graph.
